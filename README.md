# Titanic - data science project 

## INTRODUCTION
This is simple data science project designed to predict whether a given person would survive the Titanic crash.


### IMPLEMENTATION



### Notes regarding TASKS:

#### TASK1 - organizational instructions

The repository was set up on GitHub as a public repository. The work for each of the subsequent tasks (with the exception for task 1) has been completed on a separate branch - one per task - and merged back onto the master branch. The branches have not been deleted post-merging and the state of the project at the completion of each task can be investigated by viewing a corresponding branch.

#### TASK2 - sense of humour

The joke was carefully selected and uploaded in a .txt file. Note: the joke is subject to change in an event of an even funnier joke being found. :)

#### TASK3 - good practices

Since making the existing code easier to read, run and reuse requires changes to the files concerned in tasks 4-6, I decided to split work on task 3 into two phases to be merged in separately - creating an alternate version of the README.md file, and making sure the code adheres to the good practices listed once the subsequent tasks are completed. Hence, two pull requests of the task 3 branch, one before work on the task 4 has been completed, and one at the end of the project.  

#### TASK4 - feature engineering

#### TASK5 - models

#### TASK6 - measures

#### TASK7 - docker

#### TASK8 - tests

### TASK9 - prediction api
